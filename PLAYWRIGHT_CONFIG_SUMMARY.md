## 🎯 Configuration Features Implemented

### Test Execution Modes
- ✅ **Headed mode** for development (with 50ms slowMo for debugging)
- ✅ **Headless mode** for CI environments
- ✅ Automatic mode detection based on `CI` environment variable

### Browser Coverage
- ✅ **Desktop Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (Safari), Microsoft Edge
- ✅ **Mobile Browsers**: Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5), Mobile Safari (iPhone 12)
- ✅ **Tablet**: iPad (7th generation)

- ✅ Geolocation: San Juan, PR (18.4655, -66.1057)
- ✅ Permissions: Geolocation, Notifications, Camera

### Timeouts Configuration
- ✅ Test timeout: 60 seconds
- ✅ Expect timeout: 10 seconds
- ✅ Action timeout: 15 seconds
- ✅ Navigation timeout: 30 seconds

### Test Artifacts
- ✅ Screenshots on failure (full page)
- ✅ Video recording (CI only, on failure)
- ✅ Trace capture (on retry in CI, on failure locally)
- ✅ HTML reports with automatic opening on failure

### CI/CD Optimizations
- ✅ 2 retries on failure in CI
- ✅ Single worker in CI to avoid resource conflicts
- ✅ JUnit XML reports for CI integration
- ✅ Maximum 10 failures before stopping

### Development Features
- ✅ Automatic dev server startup (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Server reuse for faster test runs
- ✅ Environment variable support via `.env.test`

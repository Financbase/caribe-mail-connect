# Security Guidelines

This document outlines security best practices and review guidelines for the project.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets or sensitive information to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Store production secrets in a secure secret management system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Use `.env` for local development and ensure it's in `.gitignore`
- Rotate secrets regularly

### 2. Dependencies

- Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions
- Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Review and update dependencies using `npm outdated`
- Consider using Dependabot or similar tools for automated dependency updates

### 3. Code Security

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement rate limiting and request validation
- Set secure HTTP headers (e.g., CSP, HSTS)
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks

### 4. Secure Development

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper error handling (don't leak stack traces to clients)
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Keep sensitive information out of logs

## Code Review Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Are all endpoints properly authenticated?
- [ ] Are proper authorization checks in place?
- [ ] Are authentication tokens properly validated?
- [ ] Are passwords properly hashed?

### Input Validation

- [ ] Is all user input properly validated?
- [ ] Are there any potential injection vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Are file uploads properly validated and sanitized?

### Data Protection

- [ ] Is sensitive data properly encrypted?
- [ ] Are API keys and secrets properly managed?
- [ ] Are there any hardcoded credentials?

### Dependencies

- [ ] Are all dependencies up to date?
- [ ] Are there any known vulnerabilities in the dependencies?
- [ ] Are all dependencies necessary?

### Error Handling

- [ ] Are errors properly handled?
- [ ] Do error messages leak sensitive information?
- [ ] Are there proper logging mechanisms in place?

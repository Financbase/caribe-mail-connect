**Backup Date**: $(date)

**Projects Being Deleted**: $OLD_STAGING_PROJECT, $OLD_PRODUCTION_PROJECT

## Consolidated Project Status
- Project ID: $NEW_CONSOLIDATED_PROJECT
- Region: us-east-2
- Status: Active and Healthy
- Data: All original data preserved + migrated test users

## Projects Being Deleted
- Staging Project: $OLD_STAGING_PROJECT (minimal data, already migrated)
- Production Project: $OLD_PRODUCTION_PROJECT (no data, empty)

## Safety Measures
- 48-hour validation period completed
- All applications tested and working
- Team notified and trained
- CI/CD pipelines updated
- Final health check passed

This backup serves as a final safety measure before cleanup.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Issue: Browser Loading**

### **Problem Description**

- React app stuck on loading spinner
- Development server has WebSocket connection issues
- Multiple 503 errors for component loading
- Production build works but preview server not starting

### **Root Cause**

The issue appears to be related to:

1. **Development Server Configuration** - WebSocket port conflicts
2. **Vite HMR Issues** - Hot module replacement not working
3. **Resource Loading** - Some static assets returning 503 errors

## üöÄ **Immediate Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Use Production Build (Recommended)**

```bash
cd caribe-mail-connect
npm run build
npm run preview
# Then test at http://localhost:4173
```

### **Solution 2: Fix Development Server**

```bash
# Clear all caches
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf dist
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Start with clean configuration
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### **Solution 3: Alternative Development Setup**

```bash
# Use different port to avoid conflicts
PORT=3000 npm run dev

# Or use different host
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

### Unit Test Status

- All unit tests currently fail due to TypeScript configuration issues
- Missing `@/types/api` has been resolved
- Jest configuration updated for better TypeScript support
- @types/jest installed successfully

### Recommendations for Immediate Action

1. **Add Test IDs to UI Components**

   ```tsx
   <button data-testid="login-button" type="submit">
     Iniciar Sesión
   </button>
   ```

2. **Implement Service Worker Registration**

   ```javascript
   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
     navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');
   }
   ```

3. **Optimize Initial Page Load**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Reduce bundle size
   - Enable compression

4. **Fix TypeScript Configuration**
   - Already updated jest.config.mjs
   - Added missing type definitions
   - Created api.ts types file

### Test Commands Available

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run specific service tests
npm run test:services

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Next Steps

1. Add data-testid attributes to all interactive elements
2. Set up test user accounts and data
3. Implement missing UI components identified by failed tests
4. Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
5. Set up monitoring for test results

## Conclusion

The comprehensive test suite successfully covers all 40+ features of PRMCMS. While many tests currently fail due to missing UI elements and configuration issues, the testing infrastructure is solid and ready for use once the implementation gaps are addressed.

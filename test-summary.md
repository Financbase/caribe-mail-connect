#### ❌ Failing Test Suites

1. **usePackages Hook** (`src/hooks/__tests__/usePackages.test.ts`)
   - All tests failing
   - Issues with mock setup and async operations

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Context Provider Issues**: Initially had LanguageProvider context errors - now resolved
2. **Language/Localization**: Tests need to handle both English and Spanish UI text
3. **Mock Setup**: Some mocks not properly configured for hooks
4. **Component Mismatches**: Some tests written for different component versions
5. **Dialog/Modal Testing**: Issues with testing dialog open/close interactions

### Improvements Made

1. ✅ Created test utilities with proper provider wrappers
2. ✅ Fixed environment variable configuration for Supabase
3. ✅ Updated tests to handle bilingual UI
4. ✅ Aligned DeliveryConfirmation tests with actual component interface
5. ✅ Set up proper mock structure for testing

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Dialog Interaction Tests**: Debug why dialog open/close tests are failing
2. **Fix CustomerForm Tests**: Resolve multiple field matching issues
3. **Fix usePackages Hook Tests**: Properly configure async mocks
4. **Add Coverage Reports**: Configure and run coverage analysis
5. **Add E2E Tests**: Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Add test running to continuous integration

### Test Infrastructure

- **Test Runner**: Vitest
- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library
- **User Interactions**: @testing-library/user-event
- **Environment**: jsdom
- **Mock Support**: Vitest vi mocks

### Configuration Files

- `vitest.config.ts` - Main test configuration
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Test environment setup
- `src/test/test-utils.tsx` - Custom render with providers

### Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Notes

- Tests are configured to exclude E2E and Playwright tests from unit test runs
- Mock data is properly typed using actual application types
- All tests run with proper React context providers (Language, Auth, Router, QueryClient)

## üéØ **Immediate Action Items**

### **Critical Fixes Needed (P0):**

1. **Fix Dynamic Import Issues** - Resolve the `Index.tsx` and `intelligence.tsx` loading errors
2. **Fix Application Loading** - Ensure the main application loads after authentication
3. **Update Test Credentials** - Make TestSprite credentials work properly

### **Testing Blockers:**

- Cannot test 45 out of 46 services due to application loading failure
- Need to fix core application loading before proceeding with comprehensive testing

### **Next Steps:**

1. Fix the dynamic import and loading issues
2. Retest authentication with TestSprite credentials
3. Proceed with testing all 46 services once application loads properly

*Testing paused due to critical application loading issues. Need to fix core functionality before continuing comprehensive testing.*

### Scenario-Specific Recovery Procedures

#### Application Server Failure Recovery
```bash
# 1. Deploy to backup infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh production --force

# 2. Update DNS if necessary
# Update DNS records to point to backup servers

# 3. Verify service functionality
npm run test:smoke

# 4. Monitor system health
curl -f https://caribe-mail-connect.vercel.app/api/health
```

#### Database Recovery
```bash
# 1. Stop application to prevent data corruption
# Scale down application instances

# 2. Restore from latest backup
./scripts/backup-system.sh restore /path/to/latest/backup.tar.gz

# 3. Verify data integrity
# Run data validation scripts

# 4. Restart application
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# 5. Monitor for issues
# Check logs and metrics
```

#### Complete Infrastructure Recovery
```bash
# 1. Set up new infrastructure
# Deploy to alternative cloud provider if necessary

# 2. Restore all components
./scripts/backup-system.sh restore /path/to/full/backup.tar.gz

# 3. Update DNS and certificates
# Point domain to new infrastructure

# 4. Verify all services
npm run test:e2e

# 5. Gradual traffic migration
# Use blue-green deployment strategy
```

## üîß Recovery Tools and Scripts

### Backup System
```bash
# Create full backup
./scripts/backup-system.sh backup full

# Create incremental backup
./scripts/backup-system.sh backup incremental

# Verify backup integrity
./scripts/backup-system.sh verify /path/to/backup.tar.gz

# Restore from backup
./scripts/backup-system.sh restore /path/to/backup.tar.gz
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check system health
curl -f https://caribe-mail-connect.vercel.app/api/health

# Run comprehensive health check
npm run health:check

# Monitor performance metrics
npm run monitor:performance
```

### Emergency Deployment
```bash
# Emergency deployment with minimal checks
./scripts/deploy.sh production --force --skip-tests

# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback.sh

# Deploy to backup infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh backup-production
```
